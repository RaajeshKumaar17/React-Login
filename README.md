This is a simple and responsive Login/Signup component built using React. It allows users to toggle between login and signup modes dynamically. The component includes input fields for name, email, and password, along with icons for a user-friendly experience. A "Lost password?" option is displayed in login mode for password recovery. The UI is styled using CSS to ensure a clean and modern look. To use the component, clone the repository, install the dependencies with `npm install`, and start the application using `npm start`. It is perfect for integrating basic authentication functionality into React projects. Customize the styles in the `loginsignup.css` file to suit your application's theme. Contributions and enhancements are welcome. For more details, check the repository at [React Login](https://github.com/RaajeshKumaar17/React-Login.git).
